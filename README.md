# ProManage

#Designed and developed a full-stack web application for managing team tasks with secure authentication and role-based dashboards. The project was built using Python Flask for backend logic and HTML/CSS for frontend presentation.

Implemented features for user sign-up, login, task assignment, progress tracking, and activity logging. Integrated SQLAlchemy ORM to manage users, tasks, and logs within a relational database, with passwords stored as salted hashes and access enforced via session-based role control.

Collaborated as a two-person team: I led the frontend UI/UX development, while my teammate handled backend database integration.

Key areas covered:
• Frontend design (HTML/CSS) and Jinja templating
• Flask-based backend logic and session control
• SQLAlchemy ORM with user-role relationships
• Secure login with hashing & encryption
• Task and activity log tracking with dynamic UI updates#
